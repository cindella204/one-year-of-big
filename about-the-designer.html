			<p class="left">hi. i'm jasmine, but if you're coming from twitter you probably know me as persephone.</p>
			<p class="left">when i watched "basically i'm gay" for the first time i hadn't seen a dan  and/or video in probably five years, even though i was a diehard fan during my early high school years.</p>
			<p class="left">that fourteen-year-old was never particularly involved in the dnp fandom, and honestly, homophobic, so i hadn't spent that much time thinking about dan's sexuality or "phan."</p>
			<p class="left">post-youtube years i got more exposed to the world and realized a lot of the ideas i was raised with were bullshit, and then i went to university, figured out i was queer, and told myself i was going to come in out in may after i graduated which i ... didn't.</p>
			<p class="left">now it was june. i was casually interested in the video and decided to watch it on my longer commute home from work since i had to stop and pick up a prescription.</p>
			<p class="left">i had no intention to watch a 45-minute video by someone i wasn't actively following, especially on my phone on data on a bus.</p>
			<p class="left">i watched the whole video.</p>
			<p class="left">on the bus to the pharmacy and in line at the pharmacy, and while walking back to my apartment, and at my apartment.</p>
			<p class="left">it blew my mind.</p>
			<p class="left">(and got me back into dan and phil. and youtube in general.)</p>
			<p class="left">it spoke to me on so many levels.</p>
			<p class="left">as  queer person who grew up in a hostile environemnt.</p>
			<p class="left">as a queer person who didn't meet a single out queer person until i went to uni at 17.</p>
			<p class="left">as someone who endured trauma from my home and school environments during middle and high school that i'm stil working through.</p>
			<p class="left">as someone who dearly loves the internet as it saved my life in some ways, but also recognizes how destructive it can be.</p>
			<p class="left">the summer was hard. the busiest time of year at my job working with high-schoolers is july through mid-august as we run an intensive summer program.</p>
			<p class="left">i was overworked, frustrated by inefficiency, and watching the progress i made in something like 80 hours of intensive therapy fade away.</p>
			<p class="left">i was watching "basically i'm gay" something like once a week at that point. in full.</p>
			<p class="left-accent">you are never trapped. there is always hope. you just need to believe in yourself and get to the other side.</p>
			<p class="left">in july, i came out. i made a video, because there was too much i wanted to say. watching dan's video made me realize how powerful it is to tell a story around the actual labels.</p>
			<p class="left">it went ... okay?</p>
			<p class="left-accent">my parents, who i was most worried about, were split. i sent them an unlisted youtube link on a friday morning before work so that i'd be too busy to be anxious about it.</p>
			<p class="left">both of them weren't thrilled about that as it left them anxious during <em>their</em> work days where they couldn't watch a 50-minute video, but you know.</p>
			<p class="left">my dad and i talked on the phone the next day and that was good. a bit weird but good.</p>
			<p class="left">my mom called me the next day and it was not good. she was angry that i couldn't have just said "hey i'm gay" and instead felt the need to tell a story that she thought was unflattering to the family.</p>
			<p class="left">she asked me to not post it on social. she wanted me to reshoot parts of it.</p>
			<p class="left">i explained why i felt like i needed to tell that story. and why i wasn't reshooting anything in a video i spent two weeks on outside of working 10+ hour days.</p>
			<p class="left">she told me it was unfair to her and tried to gaslight me.</p>
			<p class="left">she also tried really hard to make it <em>just</em> about the family story, but once she got angry a lot of other homophobic and transphobic stuff rose to the surface.</p>
			<p class="left">i hung up on her and posted it a few hours later.</p>
			<p class="left">half the extended family knew about the call by the next day.</p>
			<p class="left-accent">you were born this way, it's right, and anyone that has a problem with it is wrong.</p>
			<p class="left">in september, i made a <a href="https://twitter.com/witchperspehone" target="_blank">youtube twitter account.</a></p>
			<p class="left">i made incredible friends there at a time in my life where i was extremely isolated personally.</p>
			<p class="left">in october, i got my first tattoo. there's a <a href="https://twitter.com/witchpersephone/status/1179463145942896642?s=20" target="_blank">tiny reference</a> to "basically i'm gay" in it.</p>
			<p class="left">i also bought tickets to vidcon london that month. i wanted to go to england. dan and phil could be there. my job was willing to pay for it as professional development since there was so much to learn about social media and podcasting.</p>
			<p class="left">by this point i was watching basically i'm gay about once a month, which i still do.</p>
			<p class="left">i downloaded it with youtube premium so i could watch it on my 90-minute flight home for christmas, which is stepping into the lions' den for me.</p>
			<p class="left">vidcon and the trip around it was a life changing event. i learned so much. i got to hang out with some of the friends i met on twitter. i met amazingphil. i decided while touristing in manchester that i want to go to grad school in the uk.</p>
			<p class="left">all of it started with "basically i'm gay."</p>
			<p class="left">the video is honestly the most important piece of media in my life, not because of how much i love dan, but because of how much it's taught me about growth and trauma-recovery and queer advocacy.</p>
			<p class="left">because of how much it reminds me that there could be a whole life i can't imagine on the other side of my darkest moments.</p>
			<p class="left">and that's why i made this project.</p>
