		<h1>about the project</h1>
		<p>i decided in may that i wanted to do something for the one-year anniversary of this video. i've always liked typography and lettering and i'm not a particularly skilled drawer, so it kind of made sense to something with the video transcript.</p>
		<p>at first i was thinking a book, but literally everyone i wanted to share this with wouldn't be able to see it in print. which means i'd put a lot of effort into beautiful typesetting that's going to be distorted and hard-to-read on someone's computer.</p>
		<p>and then i remembered the 'coding for visual storytelling' course i took during my last semester of uni. i hadn't done a web project since, but i kind of wanted the challenge.</p>
		<p>so this project was born. first in me drawing a lot of random shit on my work iPad with no plan and then realizing i'd have to scrap all of it.</p>
		<p>then with choosing colors and fonts using <a href="https://coolors.co/generate" target="_blank">coolors</a> and <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com">Adobe Fonts</a>.</p>
		<p>Then I designed wireframes in Adobe XD.</p>
		<img class="center" src="wireframes.png" alt="screenshot of wireframes">
		<p>I started drawing in Adobe Fresco.</p>
		<p><em>Look, I sold my soul to Adobe at the age of, like, thirteen and I have a personal Creative Cloud subscription.</em></p>
		<p>I also bought an iPad Pro at this point which I had been wanting to do for awhile, but never committed to.</p>

		<p>I then wrote the HTML and CSS in Adobe Dreamweaver, published through Github pages, and now you're seeing this site!</p>
